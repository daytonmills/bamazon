Bamazon is a simple node.js command line interface that connects to a MySQL database to demonstrate queries between the two.

## Customer View
The customer is able to only purchase products which are pulled from the database.
As you can see below the user is shown a table of products, and is prompted to select an item and quantity. Upon selection, the user is given the total price for the quantity of the selected product.

## Manager View
Unlike the Customer view, the Manager view is capable of performing multiple actions.

Like the aforementioned view however, the Manager can of course view the products in the database.

If desired, the Manager can add a new product into the database.

The manager can also view only products that are low on inventory (less than 5.)

And of course, the manager can restock any of the products.
